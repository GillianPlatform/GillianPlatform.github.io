`Gillian-JS` is the instantiation of Gillian to JavaScript ([ECMAScript ES5 Strict](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/)). It can be found in the `Gillian-JS` folder of the repository.

In this section, we start by describing its [structure](structure). We then detail the results related to the compiler [JS-2-GIL](js-2-gil). Finally, we explain how to write [symbolic tests](cosette).
