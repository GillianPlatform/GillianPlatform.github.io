# Gillian Documentation

The documentation website for [Gillian](https://github.com/GillianPlatform/Gillian), built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev).

## API reference
The API reference is bodged into Markdown from [`odoc`'s JSON output](https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/odoc/json.html); this is not perfect but seems to work well enough.

Files under `odoc/` should not be edited manually; they are automatically committed from CI jobs on the main Gillian repository.
