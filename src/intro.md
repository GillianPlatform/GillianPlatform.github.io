# What is Gillian?

**Gillian** is a framework for reasoning about program correctness and incorrectness, based on [Compositional Symbolic Execution](/publications/cse1.md) and inspired by ideas from [Separation Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_logic).

A Gillian **instantiation** is created by providing the Gillian core library with a memory model implementation and a compiler from the source language to Gillian's intermediate language, GIL. A number of [existing instantiations](/instantiations/) are available.

If you'd like to try out Gillian for yourself, take a look at the [labs & tutorials](/labs/).

To work on Gillian itself, [compile Gillian from source](/dev-install) and then check out the [development instructions](/develop).

Gillian is the focus of numerous [academic publications](/publications/).
