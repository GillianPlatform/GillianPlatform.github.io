# Gillian-C2

::: warning
Gillian-C2 is currently in development and unstable.
:::

Gillian-C2 is a new instantiation of Gillian to the C language (or more precisely, CBMC's [GOTO-C](https://diffblue.github.io/cbmc/group__goto-programs.html)). It can be found in the `Gillian-C2` folder of the repository.

Gillian-C2 requires CBMC to be present on your path. Due to differences of CBMC's compilation output across versions, you may need a particular version of CBMC; at time of writing, Gillian-C2 is built to work with CBMC version 5.14.3.
